    "One of the things I like most about IPython notebooks is the amazing accesability of documentation. If you hit the tab key while typing, a great autocompletion window comes up. If you pause once the word you are typing is complete, you receive documentation on the finction in a popup window. In newer versions it seems the same functionality is acheived by hitting shift then tab instead of tab. Hitting the tab key gives even more documentation in the popup window, and hitting it once more will give all the documentation on the word you have typed in a window below the current input cell. Another great feature is the re-evaluatable cell, which is great for making mistakes and learning from them. It allows you to type something, view the output immediately, and rapidly and iteratively change the input until you finally get the desired output (if you make tons of small mistakes like me). The built in documentation features, in combination with re-evaluatable cells are extremely helpful when using a new tool or library (like Pandas)."

    "Pandas is a Python library for data exploration, manipulation, and analysis. Primarily it includes data tables and time series data structures, along with methods for manipulating them. Dataframes are the central objects in the library, which are similar to excel spreadsheets. Pandas was inspired largely by a statistical programming language called R, and maintains many of the basic data structures and methods included in R, such as data frames.  The creators of Pandas are Financial Data Analysts.  One of the reasons some prefer Pandas to R is the fact you're coding in Python. Another reason is that it interfaces very well with other great python packages (matplotlib, numpy, etc...); in many cases you can just drop a Pandas dataframe into your favorite matplotlib or numpy functions and get the desired behavior, which is great!  It's alwo quite fast on many tasks, as it uses numpy for many basic dataframe methods. Dataframe's ability to handle missing data makes it an invaluable tool when dealing with any kind of data. "

It is easy-ish to use because Python is easy-ish to use. Its main advantages just come from its proximity to Python, and the fact that it's the only popular data analysis package out there. I'm not really a Python programmer, but I use the DataFrames and DataArrays packages in Julia for statistical analysis relatively frequently so I imagine I will use Pandas for some of the data cleaning and analysis for my final data story as well."
